# Professional README.md  Generator - using Node.js

  
## Description: 
  
README should have information about a project, but it can be hard to remember the sections to include and the markdown syntax.  This is a command-line tool that will help you quickly create a basic template for your README.md file by having you answer a series of prompts when creating your README.md for your Node.js projects. You can easily create a professional-looking README file that includes Title, Description, Table of Contents, Installation, Usage, Contributing, Test, License, and Questions section. 

Run the README.md Generator in the command line.  You will be prompt to provide information for each section. The generator will walk you through each section of the README  and help guide you in filling in all the necessary information. Once all sections are completed, the generator will generate a README.md file that you can use for your project.

Key features of the application include:

-	Markdown syntax are included and will automatically format your README file to look professional.

-	Step by step prompts to help you build your README file from top to bottom.
	
-	Prompts will include the name of the section as displayed in your README.
	
-	Wide range of most used licenses.
